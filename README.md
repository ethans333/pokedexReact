# PokeDex React App
I created a PokeDex iOS app where Pokemon and their information is displayed in a scroll view.
Just scroll to load Pokemon and tap on their cards to see more information about them!

Here's a little demo of what my app basically consists of. Although there isn't much to it, it's
the first react native app I've ever made so I don't think it's too shabby. When scrolling to load
more Pokemon the app tends to lag in order to keep up in loading the new data from a remote API, to
probably fix that I could possibly add in a loading animation or something in the future to stop the
lag. Special thanks to the folks on Stack Overflow for helping me with my questions. If you have any
suggestions or issues be sure to leave it under the 'Issues' tab. Thanks!
