# PokeDex React App
I created a PokeDex iOS app where Pokemon and their information is displayed in a scroll view.
Just scroll to load Pokemon and tap on their cards to see more information about them!

## Demo

Here's a little demo of what my app basically consists of. Although there isn't much to it, it's
the first react native app I've ever made so I don't think it's too shabby. If you have any suggestions
or issues be sure to leave it under the `Issues` tab. Thanks!
